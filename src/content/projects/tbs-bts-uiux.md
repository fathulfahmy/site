Learning Human-Computer Interaction theory in university sparked my interest in practical design application. Rather than just studying concepts like Fitts' Law, Miller's Law, and Nielsen's Usability Heuristics in abstract, I wanted to apply them to a real interface challenge.

I chose to redesign the TBS-BTS Mobile App, using it as a case study for implementing HCI principles. Working in Figma with Google Material 3 design system components, I created high-fidelity interfaces that demonstrated practical applications of Gestalt Principles, the Law of Proximity, and Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules.

The project became an exploration of how theoretical design principles translate into actual user interface decisions. I studied design systems from companies like Wise, Google, and Apple to understand how established patterns could be applied to improve usability and visual hierarchy.
