After years of using Neovim and LunarVim, I'd grown accustomed to a keyboard-driven workflow that felt incredibly efficient. However, the constant configuration tweaking and maintenance was eating into my actual coding time. While many tools have excellent Visual Studio Code integration out of the box, I missed the fluid, mouse-free navigation I'd become used to.

That's when I decided to bring the LunarVim experience directly into VS Code. Lunar Keymap is a Visual Studio Code extension that recreates those familiar keybindings and navigation patterns, allowing developers to maintain a keyboard-centric workflow without the configuration overhead of a full Neovim setup.

The extension has resonated with developers worldwide, reaching over 2,000 installs. It's been rewarding to see others benefit from the same efficiency improvements that initially motivated me to build it.
