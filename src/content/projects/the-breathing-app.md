This mobile application emerged from a Mobile Development course project that explored the intersection of health technology and mobile platforms. Built with .NET MAUI and C#, the app serves two main purposes, teaching proper breathing techniques and providing a basic assessment tool for shortness of breath concerns.

The app includes a comprehensive library of breathing techniques with detailed instructions for each method. The assessment feature guides users through a questionnaire that provides a risk score based on their responses, though it's important to note this is designed as an educational tool rather than a medical diagnostic.

Working with Firestore for data management and .NET MAUI for cross-platform development gave me valuable experience with Microsoft's mobile development stack. The project reinforced the importance of clear, accessible design when building health-related applications.
