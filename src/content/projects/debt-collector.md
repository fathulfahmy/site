Sometimes the best projects come from tight constraints. This Android application was built in just one week as part of a university Android development course, focusing on the fundamentals of mobile data management.

The app tackles a common problem, keeping track of who owes what to whom. Built with Java and Firestore, it provides a clean interface for managing debt records with the ability to add, edit, mark as complete, or delete entries. Each debt entry captures the essential information, name, amount, and date.

While simple in scope, the project was a good exercise in rapid prototyping and working within Android's development patterns. The week-long timeframe forced me to focus on core functionality and clean implementation rather than getting caught up in feature creep.
