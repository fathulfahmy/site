For my final year project, I wanted to tackle something that combined technical complexity with real-world utility. The Barter App emerged from the idea of creating a platform where people could exchange services rather than just buy and sell products.

Built with React Native for the mobile experience and Laravel for the backend API, the app includes features like in-app messaging, payment processing, user reporting systems, and a comprehensive admin panel for platform management. The technical challenge was interesting, but what made it special was the user experience design and the careful balance of features needed for a functional marketplace.

The project ended up winning the Outstanding Final Year Project Award among 57 Software Engineering students, which was incredibly validating. It was also <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/the-barter-app/" target="_blank">featured on Getstream</a>, highlighting the messaging implementation. Beyond the recognition, it was satisfying to build something that felt like a complete, production-ready platform with proper documentation for developers.
