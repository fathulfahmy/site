Leading a team of three developers on this web-based project taught me as much about collaboration as it did about web development. Built for a Web Programming course, the system handles multi-event registration with participant management and quota tracking.

The platform allows administrators to create and manage multiple events simultaneously while participants can register for events, view their registrations, and make changes as needed. The quota management system ensures events don't exceed capacity limits, while the admin interface provides comprehensive oversight of all participants and events.

Working with PHP, HTML, and CSS, we focused on creating a robust system that could handle the complexities of managing multiple concurrent events. The team dynamic was crucial to the project's success, and it was a good introduction to coordinating development work across multiple contributors.
