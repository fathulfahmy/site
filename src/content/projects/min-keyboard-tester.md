This was my very first website, built at a time when I had no formal web development training. As someone who enjoys building and testing custom mechanical keyboards, I frequently used online keyboard testers to check switches and key responsiveness. However, most existing tools were cluttered with ads and unnecessary features.

I wanted something minimal, a single page that would detect keystrokes, provide visual feedback, change colors, and play audio when keys were pressed. Using jQuery, HTML, and CSS, I built exactly that, a clean, distraction-free tool focused solely on the essential functionality.

Looking back, it's a reminder that sometimes the best learning projects come from solving your own everyday problems. The simplicity was both a constraint and a feature, and it gave me confidence to tackle more complex web development challenges later on.
