My journey into professional development began during my internship at Webby, where I got to work on diverse client projects. I built CRUD modules and statistical charts for ChargeSini's data visualization, revamped Caricarz's booking interface to reduce abandoned transactions, and optimized database queries and algorithms for Huaxin's financial system. I also engineered a contact module for KPSB Care that automated their manual support processes.
