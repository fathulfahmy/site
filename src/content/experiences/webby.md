My journey into professional development began during my internship at Webby, where I worked on diverse client projects. I built CRUD modules and statistical charts for ChargeSini using React and GraphQL, revamped booking interface to reduce abandoned transactions for Caricarz using Vue and REST API, and optimized database queries and algorithms for Huaxin using Laravel and REST API. I also engineered a contact module to automate manual support processes for KPSB Care using Laravel and GraphQL.
