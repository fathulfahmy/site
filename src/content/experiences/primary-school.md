My tech obsession actually goes way back to primary school, when I was the kid flashing custom Android ROMs just to see what different kernels could do. I spent countless hours customizing Windows with Rainmeter and exploring Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch (yes, I use Arch BTW). Dual-booting operating systems and customizing GRUB bootloaders might have seemed like overkill for a kid, but it gave me a deep appreciation for how systems work under the hood, something that still serves me well today.
