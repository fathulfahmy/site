My tech obsession goes way back to primary school, when I was a kid flashing custom Android ROMs for me and my friends. I spent hours tinkering Windows with Rainmeter, and exploring Linux distributions including Debian, Fedora, and Arch (I use Arch BTW). Dual-booting Windows and Linux as a daily driver and customizing GRUB bootloaders may seem overkill for a kid, but it gave me knowledge of how systems work under the hood, and it shaped who I am today.
