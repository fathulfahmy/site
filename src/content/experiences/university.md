During university, I pursued BSC. Computer Science (Software Engineering), learning languages such as C, C++, Java, and PHP, along with frameworks such as Laravel and React Native. At the same time, I also contributed to open-source projects such as GitHub Catppuccin and published a VS Code extension called Lunar Keymap. I enjoy the process of communicating and building with the open-source community, to deliver solutions that they use and appreciate.
