During university, I pursued Computer Science with a major in Software Engineering, learning languages like C, C++, Java, and PHP, along with frameworks such as Laravel and React Native. But honestly, some of my most valuable learning happened outside the classroom. I contributed to open-source projects like GitHub Catppuccin and published my own VS Code extension called Lunar Keymap. There's something special about building tools that other developers actually use and appreciate.
