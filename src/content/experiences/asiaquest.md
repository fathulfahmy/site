As a Full Stack Developer and AI Engineer at AsiaQuest, I developed an AI credit score microservice to help speed up loan processing for Dipo Star Finance using FastAPI and Multi-Agent RAG . I also developed an AI chatbot as an alternative to ChatGPT to protect sensitive data, deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine with Azure CI/CD pipelines. Apart from AI, I developed JavaScript customizations for Kintone, and translated business requirements into system designs with cost and timeline estimations.
