Currently, I'm working as a Full Stack Developer at AsiaQuest, where I've been building AI-powered solutions that make a real difference. I developed a credit score module using Multi-Agent RAG with OpenAI to help speed up loan processing for Dipo Star Finance. I also created an internal AI chatbot to keep sensitive data secure, deploying it on Google Kubernetes Engine with Azure CI/CD pipelines. When I'm not working on AI projects, I'm creating JavaScript customizations for Kintone or translating business requirements into system designs with cost and timeline estimations.
