Interestingly, I didn't start out thinking I'd become a software developer. I studied Civil Engineering in high school and was pursuing Automotive Engineering for my Bachelor's degree. Learning programming in Java blew my mind as I can create something out of nothing. That moment changed everything. I knew this was the path I wanted to follow, and I made the difficult decision to drop out from studying abroad in Germany under a full scholarship, taking a leap of faith into Computer Science.
